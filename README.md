## Key Features and Assumptions

- It factors in inflation for costs and some investment returns.
- Capital gains tax can be optionally applied to profits.
- The House scenario assumes a fixed mortgage rate, includes annual costs (insurance, rates, maintenance), and applies a user-defined appreciation rate.
- The Bitcoin scenario assumes a lump sum investment, includes rental costs, and treats Bitcoin as inflation-resistant.
- The Term Deposit scenario uses a fixed interest rate and applies annual tax on earnings.
- The optional Loan4Bitcoin scenario allows you to explore borrowing to invest in Bitcoin.

## Important Notes for Users

1. This is a comparative tool to help visualise potential outcomes. It is not a prediction of future performance.
2. The results are based on your inputs and our assumptions. Real-world factors like market volatility, interest rate changes, or new regulations are not accounted for.
3. The calculator assumes consistent growth rates and doesn't factor in potential market crashes or booms.
4. The Bitcoin scenario assumes Bitcoin maintains its value against inflation, which is a significant assumption.
5. The house scenario doesn't account for potential rental income if the property is an investment property.
6. You can adjust inputs using sliders or direct entry for easy comparison of different scenarios.
7. We provide CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) spread results for the House and Bitcoin scenarios to show potential variance.

**Remember:** This calculator provides a simplified model of complex financial scenarios. It's crucial to consult with financial professionals before making any investment decisions. While we strive for accuracy, this tool should be used for educational and comparative purposes only.

## Additional Considerations

1. Inflation affects all costs - insurance, rates and rent.
2. Inflation affects end purchasing power of House and Term deposit, but does not affect Bitcoin's end purchasing power as Bitcoin is argued to be deflationary and has limited supply.
3. **Bitcoin's current Compounded Annual Growth Rate is around 62% over the last 10 years**, 48% over the last 5 years ([source](https://www.calculate.co.nz/cagr-calculator.php)). This is not expected to continue at this rate, but it is impossible to predict, which is why the calculator allows you to choose the CAGR for both House and Bitcoin.
4. You have to believe in Bitcoin to believe this calculator - so do your homework.
5. **Read the Bitcoin Whitepaper**: [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)
6. Ask yourself, "What is money?"
7. Watch and listen to people who have been thinking about this deeply:
